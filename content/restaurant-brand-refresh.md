## The Challenge

La Bella Cucina, a 10-year-old Italian restaurant, had built a loyal customer base but their visual identity had become dated and no longer reflected the quality of their cuisine or ambiance. They were struggling to attract younger diners and compete with newer, more Instagram-worthy establishments.

## Our Solution

We conducted a brand audit and customer research to understand what elements resonated with existing customers. We preserved the restaurant's signature burgundy color but modernized it with a refined palette including cream, gold, and deep forest green. The new logo evolved from the old script to a more contemporary yet timeless serif wordmark with a custom illustrated basil leaf icon.

## Results

Customer traffic increased 35% within 2 months of rebrand launch. Average order value increased by 28% with the new menu design. Social media mentions increased 400%. Positive online reviews increased by 55%. The restaurant was featured in Timeout Jakarta and Jakarta Post's "Best Dining Experiences 2024."
