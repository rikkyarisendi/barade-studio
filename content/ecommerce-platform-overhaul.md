## The Challenge

BazaarHub, an established multi-vendor marketplace, was struggling with an outdated platform that had poor user experience, slow loading times, and limited vendor management capabilities. They were losing market share to competitors with checkout abandonment at 85% rate.

## Our Solution

We executed a phased redesign using headless commerce architecture with Next.js for the frontend and a custom Node.js backend. We conducted extensive UX research including user interviews, heat mapping analysis, and A/B testing to identify pain points. The new design features intuitive navigation, advanced filtering, and AI-powered recommendations.

## Results

Checkout abandonment reduced from 85% to 23%. Sales increased by 165% in the first quarter. Average session duration increased from 2 minutes to 8 minutes. Vendor satisfaction scores improved from 3.2/5 to 4.7/5. Monthly active vendors increased from 500 to 1,200.
