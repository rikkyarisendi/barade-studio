## The Challenge

Pure Leaf Organics needed packaging that would stand out on crowded retail shelves while communicating their commitment to sustainability and premium quality. The packaging needed to use eco-friendly materials, work across their range of 12 tea varieties, and appeal to health-conscious consumers.

## Our Solution

We designed a packaging system using 100% recycled kraft paper with biodegradable inks, featuring custom botanical illustrations for each tea variety. The cylindrical tin design stands out on shelves while the illustration system creates a cohesive family appearance. QR codes link to farmer stories, building emotional connections with consumers.

## Results

Products placed in 200+ retail stores within 3 months. First batch of 50,000 units sold out in 6 weeks. Won Bronze at the Asia Pacific Packaging Design Awards. Retail sell-through rate 40% higher than industry average. 85% of customers cite packaging as their primary purchase motivation.
