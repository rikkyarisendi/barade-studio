## The Challenge

Misil Tactical required an e-commerce platform capable of handling an extensive tactical gear catalog while maintaining a tough brand image. The primary challenge was organizing lots of product variants into an intuitive navigation system without compromising site speed. Furthermore, they needed a reliable infrastructure management system (domain & hosting) to ensure sales operations were never disrupted by technical issues.

## The Approach

Baradé Studio built an e-commerce platform that combines militaristic aesthetics with high-level functionality. I focused on information architecture to ensure customers could easily find products through a structured category system. On the backend, I managed all infrastructure needs transparently and developed a secure transaction flow, from catalog selection to direct admin order integration for distribution.

## Outcome

The e-commerce platform now runs stably with an organized catalog management system. The website is built for high scalability, allowing Misil Tactical to efficiently manage bulk inventory or product updates. Through a structured annual invoicing system, the client maintains full control over their digital operational costs, fostering a long-term partnership built on technical transparency.
