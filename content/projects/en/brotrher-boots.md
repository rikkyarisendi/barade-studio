## The Challenge

Brotrher had high-quality products but lacked a consistent brand identity. Visual discrepancies between their website, social media, and marketplace storefronts (Shopee/Tokopedia) made the brand look unprofessional and confused potential customers. The primary issue was the absence of a unified visual and operational standard across all digital touchpoints.

## The Approach

Baradé Studio standardized Brotrher's entire digital ecosystem. The website was established as the central brand authority, with marketplace storefronts and social media templates redesigned to match. Beyond visuals, I developed content production and inventory management SOPs to ensure the internal team could maintain daily consistency without compromising the established aesthetic standards.

## Outcome

Established a solid and trustworthy brand image ready for the national market. This visual consistency has significantly improved customer trust on marketplaces and organic engagement on social media. With a well-structured infrastructure now in place, Brotrher has a robust digital foundation for long-term growth.
