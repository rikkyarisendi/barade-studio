## The Challenge

SBA Transport has been a veteran in the tank container logistics industry since 1994, yet their previous digital presence consisted only of a basic landing page that failed to reflect their true business scale. The primary issue was an outdated design and a weak visual identity (branding), which made the company's profile appear less competitive and professional to corporate clients.

## The Approach

Baradé Studio executed a complete overhaul of both the visuals and information architecture. I transformed their old landing page into a comprehensive corporate profile website, highlighting their long-standing history and specialization in tank containers. My main focus was modernizing the look to be more brand-aligned while maintaining the established feel of the company. On the technical side, I migrated their hosting infrastructure to ensure stable and transparent performance.

## Outcome

Successfully transformed SBA Transport's digital image into one that is modern, credible, and professional. The new website now accurately represents the company's capacity as a reliable logistics provider, both visually and functionally. With better-organized infrastructure management under Baradé Studio, the SBA Transport team now possesses a solid and manageable digital asset to support their long-term business relationships.
