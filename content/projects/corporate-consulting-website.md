## The Challenge

Stratosphere Consulting, a boutique management consulting firm, had an outdated website that failed to communicate their expertise and generate qualified leads. They needed to establish thought leadership, attract C-level decision makers, and convert website visitors into consultation requests.

## Our Solution

We developed a content-first website strategy, positioning Stratosphere as thought leaders through a structured insights section, detailed case studies, and clear service pages. The design uses a sophisticated navy, silver, and white palette that communicates professionalism and reliability.

## Results

312% increase in qualified lead generation. 185% increase in organic traffic. Average session duration improved from 1:23 to 5:47. Within 6 months, the firm attributed 12 new contracts worth $2.3M directly to website-generated leads. Cost per acquisition reduced by 35%.
