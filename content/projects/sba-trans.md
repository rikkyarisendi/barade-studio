## The Challenge

As a growing transportation services company, SBA Trans needed a stable and trustworthy digital presence to reach both corporate and retail clients. The main challenge lay in managing web infrastructure that must maintain high availability, ensuring fleet information could be accessed anytime without technical disruptions. Transparent maintenance management was essential to efficiently manage .co.id domain renewal and hosting costs by the internal team on a regular basis.

## Our Solution

Baradé Studio stepped in to streamline SBA Trans's entire digital ecosystem. We migrated and optimized their hosting infrastructure to enhance access speed and data security. Additionally, we implemented a standardized annual maintenance management system—ensuring transparent renewal costs and providing responsive technical support. We also provided content direction to highlight the professionalism of their tourist bus fleet through clean visuals and reservation-focused navigation.

## Results

Successfully secured the company's official digital identity through well-organized .co.id domain management. The website infrastructure now operates with more stable performance and is protected from recurring technical issues. The transparent service management approach implemented has given SBA Trans full confidence to focus on developing their transportation operations, while Baradé Studio maintains the long-term sustainability of their digital assets.
