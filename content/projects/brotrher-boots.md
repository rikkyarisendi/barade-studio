## The Challenge

Brotrher had strong product potential in the fashion sector, but faced serious challenges with inconsistent brand identity across various platforms. The transition between the official website, social media, and marketplaces felt disconnected, creating friction in the customer journey and diminishing brand trust. The challenge was to unify the visual language, brand voice, and operational systems to maintain a solid, professional presence at every customer touchpoint.

## Our Solution

Baradé Studio executed a comprehensive branding synchronization to create a harmonious digital ecosystem. We established the website as the central brand authority, then systematically applied the visual identity across social media templates and marketplace storefronts (Shopee & Tokopedia). Beyond visual consistency, we developed standardized SOPs for inventory management and content production to ensure Brotrher's internal team could maintain daily operational consistency without losing the established aesthetic direction.

## Results

Successfully established an exclusive, trustworthy brand image ready to compete in the national market. Strong visual consistency significantly boosted organic engagement on social media and strengthened marketplace store credibility, directly driving higher sales conversion rates. With a well-structured digital infrastructure now in place, Brotrher has a solid foundation to scale the business to the next level with a proven, cohesive brand identity.
