## The Challenge

Kopi Kita Cafe approached us with a vision to create a modern coffee shop that would appeal to young professionals while maintaining a warm, community-focused atmosphere. They were entering a highly competitive market dominated by international chains and needed a distinctive brand identity that would help them stand out. The challenge was to balance professionalism with approachability, modern aesthetics with warmth, and create a brand that felt both premium and accessible.

## Our Solution

We developed a comprehensive brand identity centered around the concept of "modern warmth." The visual identity features a custom wordmark with rounded, friendly letterforms paired with a minimalist geometric icon. The color palette combines warm earth tones (terracotta, cream, and coffee brown) with a fresh sage green accent, creating a balance between comfort and contemporary style. We created a modular brand system that includes hand-drawn illustrations of coffee beans, leaves, and steam patterns that can be mixed and matched across different applications. The packaging design uses kraft paper with selective spot colors, emphasizing sustainability while maintaining a premium feel.

## Results

150% increase in brand recognition within the first 3 months of launch. The cafe was featured in Jakarta Design Magazine and won the "Best New Cafe Brand 2024" award from the Indonesian Coffee Association. Customer base grew by 40%, with 65% of new customers citing the brand aesthetic as a key factor in their first visit. Social media following increased from 0 to 25,000 followers in 4 months, with user-generated content featuring the branded packaging appearing organically.
