## The Challenge

SoundWave, a new 3-day music festival, needed to establish itself in a market dominated by established events. They required a brand identity that would appeal to Gen Z and young millennials, communicate an eclectic lineup, and create shareable social media moments while working across diverse applications.

## Our Solution

We created a dynamic, modular brand system built around "visual frequency." The logo features custom geometric letterforms that can be animated to pulse with music. The color palette uses electric purple, hot pink, cyan, and lime green – allowing different combinations for different stages. We designed animated graphic elements and templates for all touchpoints.

## Results

Festival sold out all 10,000 tickets in 5 days. Social media campaign generated 15 million impressions. #SoundWaveFest trended on Twitter during the festival. Merchandise sales exceeded projections by 185%. The festival secured 15 major sponsors (double the initial goal). Won Gold at the Indonesian Design Awards.
